Read Me :

It is an Admin Finder coded on "Perl" Scripting Language. 
Basically Its starts to check for "admin pages" mainly for Authentication Bypass and many more. 
It has the capability to check and take the user input for the admin page they are wanting to get, means, the admin page 
for which platform (Asp,PHP etc..). 
Its helpful for a quick search and decrease the time for finding an amount of different possibiities of admin uri given inside. 
There are also an option for the person who does not even know on which platform the website is on so it arbitarily finds all the possibilities.

It is the right now in Beta Stage. so do check and give me the feedback.
